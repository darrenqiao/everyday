## Lending and borrowing

#### How do you feel if they don't return.

It is vey disappointing if someone doesn't return a borrowed item. 

It also can be very frustrating if I can not remember who I lent it to.

But actually, I rarely encounter this kind of situations in my daily life.

#### Do you like to lend things to others?

It depends, if the person is my friend, I will be very willing to do that. If I don't know the guy, I will hesitate before lending things to him/her.

#### Have you ever borrowed money from others?

Yes. You know, in China we use Alipay and Wechat pay more often than cash, so I usually just take a phone with me when buying something. Once I went into a shop to buy some kitchen supplies with my friends, but the store only received cash, so I had to borrow a small amount of money from one my friends.

#### Have you borrowed books from others?

I have many friends who **have a similar taste in books to me**, so we often lend each other books. And also in my company, we have a small books sharing group, if someone is reading a book and thinks the book is worth reading. They will share it with others and we can borrow it for a while.
