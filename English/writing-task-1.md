**To do this**, rent a house big enough to **accommodate** the whole family.

To participate this special **occasion**, I would need to **be away from office** for four days, **from** Monday 12th to Thursday 23rd. 

My schedule for that week **is relatively light**, apart from two meeting with clients.

Joe would be able to attend these **in my place** (take my place), as he has **had previous dealings** with both companies and knows **relevant staff** there.

I have no other **urgent work commitments** at that time.
